4. [X] func: deleteBook
    - Now functioning
    - Was facing issues, i was trying to apply event listener before the elements were present in the DOM
    - fixed by adding event listener to each book delete button on creation.
    - also faced issues with using delete from object / remove from dom (i needed a break)
5. [X] func: updateReadStatus
    Goal: Button that changes appearance based on read status of each book.

            * For toggling classes, you should either toggle in style of dark
                mode (default style vs dark mode) or have function check read read-status boolean
                and then react based on this seperated style classes for button. 
            * 1 class for button style, and 2 different classes based on read-status

Approach: 

Log:

    Goal: reorganize book structure. Currently site is functional, but it does not look appealing. Responsive elements are too responsive. 

    Approach: Remove visual aspects. Make a working card-style display. Once this is working, I can re-add styles.
